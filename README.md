Revolutionizing Teamwork and Client Collaboration

In the fast-paced world of teamwork, especially with remote clients, we recognize the challenges of communicating design updates effectively. That's why we, the tBoys, are proud to present our innovative solution - "Reviewed."

Reviewed is a cutting-edge cross-platform app designed to streamline the feedback and update process between designers and clients. Once the designer completes a design, they can easily share it with the
client through Reviewed. 

### Here's how it works:

1. Seamless Communication: The client receives the design and gains the power to provide
feedback directly on the design itself. Using intuitive tools, the client can add pins, draw circles,
or highlight specific areas where they would like updates or modifications.
2. Efficient Updates: With the client's specific feedback visible on the design, the designer gains an
immediate understanding of the requested changes. This process accelerates updates
significantly compared to the traditional back-and-forth exchange of emails or messages.
3. Organized Collaboration: When multiple updates are required (e.g., numerous pins on the
drawing or video), the designer can address them methodically, one by one. Each pin is directly
connected to a comment, allowing the designer and client to discuss the changes until the client
is fully satisfied.
4. Real-time Iteration: As the designer works on each update, the client can witness the progress in
real-time. This real-time iteration fosters transparent collaboration, builds trust, and ensures the
final product aligns perfectly with the client's vision.
5. Time and Resource Optimization: The streamlined feedback loop in Reviewed ensures that both
the designer's and client's time is utilized efficiently. This platform minimizes potential
misunderstandings and eliminates unnecessary revisions, saving valuable time and resources for
all parties involved.
Reviewed is not only a game-changer for designers and clients but also a catalyst for more productive
teamwork. By enhancing communication, fostering creative dialogues, and expediting updates,
Reviewed transforms the way projects are executed, taking collaboration to new heights.
